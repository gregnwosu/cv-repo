* Commercial & Technical Experience
** July 2016 - April 2017, Self Employed: [[https://www.aimia.com/][Aimia]]
*** Machine Learning Engineer
**** Responsibilities
Working within a new team for monetising Aimia's vast data repository. My responsibilities initially
were helping migrate a Aimia service to a more robust framework (EMR).
(This wasn't within my remit; but as the new team was not yet properly formed , I rolled up my sleeves and helped out.)
I then moved into co-designing and developing a platform to capture all the data needed for the machine learning techniques we wished to use.
This completed, I then developed real-time ETL spark streams for data out of the legacy hive data-warehouse so data could easily be used in a variety of machine learning algorithims.
Choosing parquet because of its schema evolution and performance properties.
At this stage I was offered the job of lead engineer on the team which I turned down because my wife and children wanted to go travelling.
I completed a brief prototype migration to  the [[http://answerrocket.com/][answer rocket]] platform so that some less technical analysts could evaluate natural language analytics.
I spent my final months implementing machine learning algorithms with the datascientists such word2vec for domains and clustering the websites into categories.
