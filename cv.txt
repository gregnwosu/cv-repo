SUMMARY


I am a technology enthusiast with a lot of experience in functional
programming and big data technologies. I’ve some commercial experience
in machine learning but the majority of my experience is from personal
projects and online courses. I’ve just arrived back after travelling for
6 months in SE Asia touring places of cultural and technological
interest with my family. I am certified in machine learning from
Stanford University’s course. I’m currently half way through Udacity’s
Deep Learning Foundation Course with a view to complete the Udacity’s
Self Driving Car NanoDegree next year. My goal is to achieve the []
position of being adept in machine learning and data science together
with my current skills of big data engineering and ETL.



CURRENT INTERESTS


My current interests are almost exclusively in FP, including:

-   Embedded DSL's using the Fixed Point Combinator in Haskell,
-   Purescript S.P.A.'s
-   Idris
-   Bayesian Methods for Data Analytics
-   Machine Learning , LSTM Generative Nets
-   Parsec like Parsing
-   General chore automation, planning on creating Internet of things
    devices.
-   Haskell FFI - recently created and open sourced the blink1device
    Haskell FFI API

Other hobbies include:

-   Cycling
-   studying civil litigation and human rights law
-   Zen Meditation.
-   I have also trained to teach adults and am a mentor to children
    learning to code at CoderDojo.



COMMERCIAL & TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE


July 2016 - April 2017, Self Employed: Aimia

Machine Learning Engineer

1.  Responsibilities

    Working within a new team for monetising Aimia's vast data
    repository. My responsibilities initially were helping migrate a
    Aimia service to a more robust framework (EMR). (This wasn't within
    my remit; but as the new team was not yet properly formed , I rolled
    up my sleeves and helped out.) I then moved into co-designing and
    developing a platform to capture all the data needed for the machine
    learning techniques we wished to use. This completed, I then
    developed real-time ETL spark streams for data out of the legacy
    hive data-warehouse so data could easily be used in a variety of
    machine learning algorithims. Choosing parquet because of its schema
    evolution and performance properties. At this stage I was offered
    the job of lead engineer on the team which I turned down because my
    wife and children wanted to go travelling. I completed a brief
    prototype migration to the answer rocket platform so that some less
    technical analysts could evaluate natural language analytics. I
    spent my final months implementing machine learning algorithms with
    the datascientists such word2vec for domains and clustering the
    websites into categories.
